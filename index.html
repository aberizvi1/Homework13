          <h5>Introduction</h5>
          <p>
            The American Community Survey (ACS) is an ongoing survey that provides vital information on a yearly basis
            about our nation and its people. Information from the survey generates data that help determine how more
            than $675 billion in federal and state funds are distributed each year.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through the ACS, we know more about jobs and occupations, educational attainment, veterans, whether people
            own or rent their homes, and other topics. Public officials, planners, and entrepreneurs use this
            information to assess the past and plan the future. When you respond to the ACS, you are doing your part to
            help your community plan for hospitals and schools, support school lunch programs, improve emergency
            services, build bridges, and inform businesses looking to add jobs and expand to new markets, and more.
          </p>
          <p>
            This analysis is based on 2014 ACS 1-Year estimates. The dataset contains median and percentage values for
            various demographic and public health factors like
            poverty levels, income, age, smoking history, etc.

          <h5>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h5>
          <p>
            We can make below observations from the data analyzed:
            <ul>
              <li>MS is the state with top poverty level, while TX has most people who lack health insurance.</li>
              <li>NH has least poverty levels.</li>
              <li>NH has least poverty levels.</li>
              <li>WV has highest percentage of people who are smokers while UT has the least.</li>
              <li>Majority of smokers fall into age group 35 to 40.</li>
              <li>NJ has highest median income, while MS has the least (which correlates with the poverty level
                observation).</li>
              <li>In general, lower income people seem to smoke more.</li>
              <li>MS and WV top in obesity levels.</li>
              <li>UT has least median age.</li>
            </ul>
